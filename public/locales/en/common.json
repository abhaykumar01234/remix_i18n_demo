  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_2_ANSWER": "Research shows software buyers tend to value reviews as much as personal recommendations.

They can also provide a wealth of expertise about how to best-leverage your reviews in your sales and marketing strategies.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_4": "What's included in my Review Collection Service Toolkit?",

  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_8": "What happens when I run out of free incentives to offer?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_8_ANSWER": "When your product runs out of incentives the review recruitment link will redirect to Gartner Digital Market's organic review form. The link does not expire or break, but we encourage vendors to update the campaign messaging to remove the promise of incentives.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_9": "Can I collect reviews in languages other than English?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_9_ANSWER": "Yes, we support generating in-language reviews. Today we offer the Review Collection Service in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, and Japanese.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_10": "How will in-language reviews be displayed?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_10_ANSWER": "Reviews submitted in the site's language will be sorted to the top, while reviews submitted in a language foreign to the site will be sorted at the bottom; e.g., Capterra.com will have English reviews at the top and French reviews at the bottom, while Capterra.fr will have French reviews at the top and English reviews at the bottom.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_11": "How can I collect in-language reviews?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_11_ANSWER": "We have developed a native-translated Central Reviews Form and user experience for reviewers to toggle the language to their desired language. The language is selected by default for reviewers accessing via the local sites. Vendors soliciting reviews from foreign users should use this translated Central Reviews Form.<br /><br /><em>Note: In-language reviews can be submitted now through any Central Reviews Form. If the review is entirely in one of the languages we support, we will translate it to English for Reviews QA to validate and publish it no matter the source Central Reviews Form. The published review will be in the language that was initially submitted.</em>",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_12": "How do I access and share the translated Central Reviews Form?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_12_ANSWER": "You may access their profile page on each local site (e.g. Capterra.fr) and copy the translated Central Reviews Form's URL, which they may then share.<br /><br />Alternatively, when users land on the form, they can toggle the language themselves via the \"switch language\" button at the bottom of the form.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_13": "What sites support this Translated Central Reviews Form?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_13_ANSWER": "Translated Central Reviews Forms are now supported on all Gartner Digital Markets sites - Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_14": "Can I incentivize in-language reviews through the Reviews Email Campaign feature?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_14_ANSWER": "At this time, we do not support translated, incentivized review UX for Reviews Email Campaign.

Users may select any of the 7 supported languages when claiming their rewards.</li></ul>",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_15": "Does Gartner Digital Markets support incentivized in-language reviews for the Review Collection Service?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_15_ANSWER": "Yes, we do! The new Review Collection Service allows for custom review campaign links by product, language, and currency. Each product has a set number of incentives which support campaign links for other languages and currencies. Reviewers outside the United States will follow <a href=\"https://digital-markets.gartner.com/claim-gift-cards-intl\">these steps</a> to claim their gift cards.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_16": "Can I view the translated version of the review?",

  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_18": "How does the Quality Assurance process work with in-language reviews?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_18_ANSWER": "Quality Assurance will process the translated version of in-language reviews. There are scenarios where the English translation will fail the \"content check\" step of the process, but would pass in the other languages. We will continue to disable these reviews and the International team will manually review the in-language text and make a publish decision based on the content quality.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_19": "Will Gartner Digital Markets offer compliance/support in supported languages?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_19_ANSWER": "Yes. Vendors or reviewers who send an email to <a href=\"reviews@capterra.com\">reviews@capterra.com</a> in local languages can expect to have their ticket addressed in the supported language. Our compliance team will work with the international team via a manual process for the time being.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_20": "What constitutes a supported in-language review?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_20_ANSWER": "The review must have 60% or more of the content written in a single supported language to be considered for publishing. So, if the review is written in mixed languages, it will not be translated and should not be published.<br /><br />The Reviews Quality Assurance team will still maintain the right to not publish mixed language reviews at their own discretion.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_21": "Where can I find the Terms & Conditions for the Review Collection Service?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_FAQS_QUESTION_21_ANSWER": "You can find the Terms & Conditions for the Review Collection Service <a href=\"https://digital-markets.gartner.com/Review-Collection-Service-Terms-Conditions\">here</a>, or in the <a href=\"https://digitalmarkets.gartner.com/reviews/gather_reviews\">Collect Reviews Page</a> in your Vendor Portal.",

You're also welcome to reach our reviews consultants via <a href=\"mailto:GetReviews@gartner.com\">GetReviews@gartner.com</a> during standard US business hours.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_1": "How are Review Quotes Generated?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_1_ANSWER": "Products must have a minimum of 10 reviews to unlock Review Quotes. Quotes are pulled from reviews recruited in the last 24 months. At the beginning of each month, our algorithm selects quotes after assessing the sentiment and quality of your recent reviews. This produces the best quotes for you to showcase in your sales and marketing materials.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_2": "Does every review have a Review Quote?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_2_ANSWER": "No. Gartner Digital Marketsâ algorithm accounts for quality-focused criteria (e.g. sentiment, recency, grammar, spellingâ¦ etc) to help you produce the best Review Quotes. For example, a quote may not be produced if the review is overly negative, contains misspellings, or if many reviewers have used similar word combinations to describe why your product and customer service are great.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_3": "My portal says that I need to collect more reviews to get Review Quotes. How do I unlock this feature?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_3_ANSWER": "Vendors are encouraged to generate <em>at least</em> 10 reviews to unlock Review Quotes for each product listed. While recruiting 10 reviews unlocks access to Review Quotes, you must have a sufficient quantity of high quality reviews content from the last 24 months to generate quotes. This provides prospective buyers a greater opportunity to find a variety of testimonials about why customers enjoy working with you, and helps them discover more about your product functionality, customer service experience, and industry expertise, all from your customer base. To recruit more reviews, we recommend using our no-cost <a href=\"https://digitalmarkets.gartner.com/reviews/gather_reviews\">Review Collection Service</a>.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_4": "Can I gather 10 reviews and not have any Review Quotes in my portal?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_4_ANSWER": "Yes. Having 10+ reviews unlocks the tool, but reviews must meet sufficient qualify-focused criteria to generate Review Quotes for your product. Collecting more recent reviews should allow the tool to work as intended.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_5": "How often do new Review Quotes appear?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_5_ANSWER": "Available Review Quotes are refreshed at the beginning of each month.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_6": "Do Review Quotes expire?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_6_ANSWER": "Yes. Once a Review Quote is older than 24 months it will no longer appear in the Vendor Portal. We know buyers find recent reviews to be more relevant to their purchase decisions, particularly reviews from the past 24 months, so we recommend showcasing your most recent reviews.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_7": "After expiration, do Review Quotes break if embedded in our sales/marketing materials?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_7_ANSWER": "No. Once you've implemented a quote it will not break or go blank. Although, we highly recommend replacing outdated Review Quotes with more recent ones, as buyers trust more recent reviews.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_8": "Are Review Quotes customizable by brand - Capterra, Software Advice, GetApp?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_8_ANSWER": "Yes. You may select the brand or brands that best fit your buyers.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_9": "Can you edit the text in Review Quotes?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_9_ANSWER": "No. Review Quotes are not editable to ensure the authenticity of the quote is maintained, which buyers have told us that they prefer.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_10": "Can a Review Quote be translated to other languages?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_10_ANSWER": "Review Quotes are only available in English at this time. Note that we may offer options for translation or more language offerings in the future. You're able to quote reviews written in other languages according to review <a href=\"https://www.capterra.com/legal/content-policy\">usage guidelines</a>.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_11": "Are Review Quotes embeddable for use in marketing?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_11_ANSWER": "Yes, you can embed them with a unique HTML code.",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_12": "How do I place a Review Quote on my marketing assets?",
  "REVIEWS_RCS_QUOTES_FAQS_QUESTION_12_ANSWER": "Embedding a Review Quote in your sales and marketing collateral is as easy as copy/paste. Simply click on the Review Quote you would like to use, copy the custom HTML to your clipboard, and insert it on your landing page or marketing asset via a standard editing tool. Weâve seen software providers use Review Quotes in these four main areas to power their marketing efforts:<ul><li><strong>Demand Generation</strong> - Add to key websites and landing pages to showcase brand reputation and gain visibility in the market</li><li><strong>Email Marketing</strong> - Build credibility by adding trusted social proof to commercial emails and nurture tracks</li><li><strong>Content Development</strong> - Insert Voice of Customer (VoC) throughout your content funnel with recent authentic reviews</li><li><strong>Sales Enablement</strong> - Add testimonials from customers into sales cycles to limit the deal-halting requests for referrals</li></ul>",

This is your guide to landing page best practices to ensure you're converting traffic into leads at a high rate. Let's get started.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-2": "Landing page optimization. For many types of pay-per-click campaigns, businesses use a dedicated standalone landing page. We recommend utilizing a landing page for your Gartner Digital Markets PPC campaigns for a couple of reasons.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-3": "First, it presents buyers with only the most relevant product information targeted to what they're looking for. And secondly, it removes navigation distractions and clickable links that can move buyers away from the lead capture form.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-4": "Here a few best practices for a well-optimized landing page. When a buyer first lands on your landing page, you want to quickly confirm they're in the right place and entice them to continue to scroll down the page. To do this, the heading of your page needs to include a strong value proposition, explaining how your product is unique from its competitors and explain the characteristics of your ideal customer or target market. Also, use a subheading to further personalize your value prop, including clear details about your target market, such as \"perfect for companies with less than twenty-four users.\" This helps ensure buyers whether or not they are a good fit for your product.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-5": "Next, you need content to help buyers make an educated decision. We recommend organizing this content in a concise, easy-to-scan format. Short videos around three to four minutes long are a great way to quickly deliver your product details. If you don't have the time or resource is for a short video, bullet points worked just as effectively speak with the specific pain points that buyers have and explain how your solution can solve the problem better than your competitors.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-6": "If you're listed to multiple categories, we recommend making unique landing pages so that each has copy in the header that reflects the category's audience. Customize your destination URLs for each category under the listings tab of your portal to accommodate category-specific landing pages. The most important aspect of your landing page is the call to action or CTA.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-7": "Once you peek buyers' interests, what action do you want them to take? Do you want them to engage with your demo or entered directly into your trial? Direct buyers to convert into a lead by including a call to action in a short online form, we find that action-oriented CTAs, such as \"free trial\" or \"free demo\" tend to convert at the highest rate. If a buyer knows exactly what will happen after they complete a form, they're more likely to provide their contact details. This is the same reason that vague offers such as \"contact us\" or \"learn more\" do not perform as well.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-8": "The second key feature of the lead capture process is a short online form. We've found that the ideal form spans four to six fields, asking only the information absolutely necessary for your sales team to know before contacting that lead. This typically includes name, phone number, email, address, and maybe a qualifying field, such as the number of users or job title. The shorter the form, the more leads you're likely to generate. If your sales team does need more information, however, we recommend creating a two-part form, which collects essential personal information from a buyer in the first step and further qualifies the lead in the second step. That way, if a buyer drops off in the second step, your sales team still has the personal information from the first step and is able to follow up. The submit button of your form should reinforce your offer and push some urgency if you're called to action is \"free demo\" the language of your submit button should be something like \"start demo now.\"",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-9": "Next are trust elements, which are essential to include in order to build credibility for buyers that may not be familiar with your brand or product. Trust elements include customer testimonials, the company logos, awards, or a reputable news sources your product has been featured in. Trust elements should be used throughout the page in different formats, whether it's logos, written testimonials, or even video testimonials. That way, potential buyers can see the type of companies that typically see success with your product.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-10": "Lastly, the overall look and feel of your page should look modern and up to date with your current product offerings. Visuals are a great way to accompany copy on your landing pages. We find that companies often use visuals like screenshots and iconography in addition to their text. Use plenty of white space to allow buyers to digest the content and use directional cues like arrows to point important features on the page.",
  "RESOURCES_ONBOARDING_BLOCK-2_VIDEO-6_TRANSCRIPT_PARA-11": "If you don't have the resource is to create a landing page internally, Gartner Digital Markets has a landing page team in-house that has proven to increase conversion rates time and again.

  "CONVERSION-TRACKING_CLICKS-INSTALLATION_PARA-3": "The first step you should take is to identify which element on the page you would like to use to trigger the conversion tracking code when clicked. Below we use a button as an example.",
  "CONVERSION-TRACKING_CLICKS-INSTALLATION_PARA-4": "As you can see, we have given the button the id âsubmitFormButtonâ. It is fine if you already have a different id assigned to your element.

  "CONVERSION-TRACKING_CLICKS-INSTALLATION_PARA-5": "For the code below, add this to the same page where the button is embedded, just before the closing </body> tag in the page HTML.

  "CONVERSION-TRACKING_CLICKS-INSTALLATION_FOOTNOTE": "If you plan to track conversions on form submissions, avoid overcounting conversions by making sure your form is correctly completed before allowing the conversion tracking code to be triggered.
